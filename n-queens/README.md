# N-queens

Accepts argument n and outputs a reduction of the N-queens problem to a SAT problem in CNF

Compile and run in an C++ IDE

Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3

Included is the file for n=32 for which our sat solver is expected to take more than 1 min on a 2020 average pc
